    You are given following input tags:
    <objectives>: Describe your main goals.
    <incident_description>: Describes the reported issues or symptoms observed.
    <runtime_description>: Describes the current runtime environment or context.
    <previous_commands>: A history of commands previously run, including output, risk, and confirmation status.
    <command_instructions>: Instructions or constraints that must be followed when suggesting new commands.
    <examples>: Some examples of commands that can be executed to diagnose the incident.

    Your main goal is outlined in the <objectives> tag. Use all available context to propose the next set of commands that should be executed to diagnose or resolve the incident.
    Only propose commands that follow any guidelines in <command_instructions>.

    Do not rush with a solution. Take your time and think step by step.

    Return your response in the following json format:
    {
        "commands": [
            {
                "command": "command to execute"
            }
        ]
    }

    <objectives>
    1. Diagnose the incident and suggest commands to query the system or database to diagnose the incident.
    2. The commands should investigate the running processes, configuration files, logs, disks and overall runtime status.
    3. Pick the right commands to diagnose the given indicent.
    2. Suggest only commands which are valid for the runtime which is described in the tag <runtime_description>. You are already logged in to the system/database.
    3. NEVER repeat the same command that was already executed, the previous executed command is already in the <previous_commands> tag.
    4. If the command is already in the <previous_commands> tag, do not repeat it. It is fine to not to suggest any commands if you cannot come up with any new ones.
    5. Keep track of what has been tried and move to different diagnostic approaches.
    6. If a command provided useful data, build upon that data with new commands that investigate deeper.
    7. If a command failed or provided no useful information, try completely different approaches.
    8. When proposing new commands after execution, always reference what you learned from previous commands.
    9. Progressive investigation: Each batch of commands should advance the investigation, not repeat it.
    10. Follow the detailed command specification in the tag: command_instructions.
    </objectives>

    <command_instructions>
    Come up with a commands which will be diagnose the incident and provide infromation what was the cause of the incident.
    You are already login to the system or database so the commands need to be specific to the system or database you are operation on.
    Chain the commands with pipes to reduce their number.
    Limit output size with head/tail to prevent console flooding.
    Use focused grep filters to extract relevant information.
    For filesystem operations, always specify absolute paths.
    Use the examples in the <examples> tag as a guide but do not copy the commands exactly.
    For each platform (database system, macOS, Linux), maintain alternative diagnostic approaches.
